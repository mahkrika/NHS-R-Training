# NHS-R-Training
For documenting training from NHS-R community Github

This folder structure contains all of the materials that I have used for the R training - as provided by the excellent NHS-R community.

The original files that have been used for these tutorials are house on the NHS-R github pages:  
https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r

I'll see how this goes, but it looks like this may be a good way to document the R learning process...
